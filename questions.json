"question": "The passage provides information in support of which of the following assertions?\nIn terrestrial environments, gravity places special demands on the cardiovascular system of animals. Gravitational pressure can cause blood to pool in the lower regions of the body, making it difficult to circulate blood to critical organs such as the brain. Terrestrial snakes, in particular, exhibit adaptations that aid in circulating blood against the force of gravity. The problem confronting terrestrial snakes is best illustrated by what happens to sea snakes when removed from their supportive medium. Because the vertical pressure gradients within the blood vessels are counteracted by similar pressure gradients in the surrounding water, the distribution of blood throughout the body of sea snakes remains about the same regardless of their orientation in space, provided they remain in the ocean. When removed from the water and tilted at various angles with the head up, however, blood pressure at their midpoint drops significantly, and at brain level falls to zero. That many terrestrial snakes in similar spatial orientations do not experience this kind of circulatory failure suggests that certain adaptations enable them to regulate blood pressure more effectively in those orientations. One such adaptation is the posterior location of the terrestrial snake’s heart, which helps to ensure adequate blood flow to the brain regardless of the snake’s orientation in space. The heart of sea snakes, in contrast, is located in the middle of the body, a position that minimizes the work required to circulate blood throughout the body. Sea snakes, which dwell in trees and spend much of their time in an upright position, have hearts located closer to their heads than do terrestrial snakes. The location of the heart in arboreal snakes can be as little as 15 percent of overall body length. Such a location requires that blood circulated to the tail of the snake travel a greater distance back to the heart, a problem solved by another adaptation. When climbing, arboreal snakes often pause momentarily to wiggle their bodies, causing waves of muscle contraction that advance from the lower torso to the head. By compressing the veins and forcing blood forward, these contractions apparently improve the flow of venous blood returning to the heart.",
"options": ["The disadvantage of an adaptation to a particular feature of an environment often outweighs the advantages of that adaptation.", "The advantages of a particular adaptation are often outweighed by the disadvantages of that adaptation.", "The location of a particular organ in an animal is often determined by the animal’s environment.", "Adaptations that are beneficial in one environment are often detrimental in another environment."],
